Logging is always done on stdout \.SH "SYNTAX" A tq script file is a lisp\-syntax program which is executed by the built\-in lisp interpreter\. The primitives of tq are represented by lisp lambdas which can be called and composed to control the behaviour of tq\. \.SH "ENVIRONMENT" Several functions of tq may be configured to use TLS \- eg for HTTPS or for using TLS\-based transport for nanommg\.org sockets\. TLS is configured using a few simple environment variables: \.IP "[ci]" 4 \efBTQ_TLS_CERT\efR A file containing the PEM\-encoded certificate (+ chain)\. \.IP "[ci]" 4 \efBTQ_TLS_KEY\efR A file containing the PEM\-encoded private key\. \.IP "[ci]" 4 \efBTQ_TLS_CLIENT_CA\efR A file containing the PEM\-encoded certificates used to validate client certificates\. \.IP "" 0 \.P If \efBTQ_TLS_CLIENT_CA\efR is set tq will require client certificate authentication for all connections\. \.SH "AUTHOR" tq is maintained by Leif Johansson \efI\e%mailto:leifj@sunet\.se\efR \.SH "SOURCE" \.IP "[ci]" 4 \efI\e%https://github\.com/SUNET/tq\efR \.IP "" 0 \.SH "COPYRIGHT" tq is made available under a 2\-clause BSD license\.
