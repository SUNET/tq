tq(1) -- TinyQ
==============

## SYNOPSIS

`tq` [--loglevel=<level>] <files>*

## DESCRIPTIOPN

* tq (pronounced "tiny queue") is a small self-contained message-bus relying heavily on nanomsg.org sockets to send and
receive JSON messages.

* tq is configured using small programs in a lisp-like dialect. 

* tq is written in GO but is typically distributed as a self-contained binary

## OPTIONS

* `--loglevel`=<level>:
  Set the loglevel. Default is "info". Options are warn,info,error and debug. Logging is always done on stdout

## SYNTAX

A tq script file is a lisp-syntax program which is executed by the built-in lisp interpreter. The primitives of 
tq are represented by lisp lambdas which can be called and composed to control the behaviour of tq.

## ENVIRONMENT

Several functions of tq may be configured to use TLS - eg for HTTPS or for using TLS-based transport for nanommg.org
sockets. TLS is configured using a few simple environment variables:

* `TQ_TLS_CERT`
  A file containing the PEM-encoded certificate (+ chain).

* `TQ_TLS_KEY`
  A file containing the PEM-encoded private key.

* `TQ_TLS_CLIENT_CA`
  A file containing the PEM-encoded certificates used to validate client certificates.

If `TQ_TLS_CLIENT_CA` is set tq will require client certificate authentication for all connections.
